# Tutorial-Website
My first go at making a website following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s
I will be adding various frontend and backend features using React and Express respectively.
Not meant to be treated as a finished product, mostly having fun and experimenting with different features.
