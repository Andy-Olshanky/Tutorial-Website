# Tutorial-Website
My first go at making a website following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s
I will be adding various frontend and backend features using React and Express respectively.
Not meant to be treated as a finished product, mostly having fun and experimenting with different features.

## TODO
Make a page showing off services as well as pages to more information.
Make a dropdown menu for services by hovering over the button.
Make it possible to contact us.
Make it possible to sign up.
Make an email blast to anyone signed up.
Implement a youtube video into the site.
Add links to other sites.
